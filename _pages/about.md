I am assistant professor in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://www.stat.nus.edu.sg) at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg). I am broadly interested in inference and methodology on high-dimensional data.

Ongoing Research Themes:
 * Gaussian and Bootstrap Approximations
 * Analysis of Missing/ Incomplete Data
 * Semiparametric Inference
 * Quantile Regression
 * Empirical Process Theory

Before joining the National University of Singapore, I was acting assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at University of Washington and postdoc in the Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering at Princeton University.
