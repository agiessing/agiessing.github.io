I am an acting assistant professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uw.edu) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu). My research is supported by the National Science Foundation (grant num. DMS-2310578). I am broadly interested in inference on high-dimensional data. 

Ongoing Research Themes:
 * Inference on Semiparametric Models
 * Gaussian and Bootstrap Approximations
 * Analysis of Missing/ Incomplete Data
 * Quantile Regression
 * Empirical Process Theory

Before joining the University of Washington, I was Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University. I hold a PhD in Statistics from the University of Michigan, a MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science (UK), and a BSc in Economics from the University of Bonn (DE).
