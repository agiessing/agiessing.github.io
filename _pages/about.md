# My research leverages statistical science to make AI more reliable and robust in the real world. Some topics of recent interest include

# adversarial and distributional robustness,
# algorithmic fairness,
# learning under distribution shifts.
# Before coming to Seattle, I was Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University. I obtained a PhD in statistics from the University of Michigan, a MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science (UK) and a BSc in Economics from the University of Bonn (DE).



# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
