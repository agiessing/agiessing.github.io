I am acting assistant professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uw.edu) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu). I am broadly interested in inference on high-dimensional data. My research is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF DMS-2310578). 

Ongoing Research Themes:
 * Gaussian and Bootstrap Approximations
 * Analysis of Missing/ Incomplete Data
 * Semiparametric Inference
 * Quantile Regression
 * Empirical Process Theory

Before joining the University of Washington, I was postdoc in the [Dept. of Operations Research and Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu) at Princeton University. I hold a PhD in Statistics from the [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats), a MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk), and a BSc in Economics from the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/de?set_language=de).
